# planetary_scientist_assistant/sci_utils/__init__.py

# This file makes the 'sci_utils' directory a Python package.
# Its presence allows for imports like:
#   from . import unit_converter
#   from . import calculator
# Or, if planetary_scientist_assistant is in sys.path:
#   from sci_utils import unit_converter

# This file can be empty.
# print("sci_utils package initialized.") # For debugging if needed.

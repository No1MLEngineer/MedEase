# planetary_scientist_assistant/experiment_support/__init__.py

# This file makes the 'experiment_support' directory a Python package.
# Its presence allows for imports like:
#   from . import logbook
# Or, if planetary_scientist_assistant is in sys.path:
#   from experiment_support import logbook

# This file can be empty.
# print("experiment_support package initialized.") # For debugging if needed.

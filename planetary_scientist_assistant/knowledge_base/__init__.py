# planetary_scientist_assistant/knowledge_base/__init__.py

# This file makes the 'knowledge_base' directory a Python package.

# To enable easier imports like:
# `from knowledge_base import document_manager`
# or potentially even:
# `from knowledge_base import add_document` (if we choose to expose functions directly)

# For now, this __init__.py can remain empty. Its presence is what matters
# for Python to recognize 'knowledge_base' as a package, allowing imports
# such as `from knowledge_base import document_manager` from `main.py`
# (assuming `main.py` and `knowledge_base/` are structured correctly relative
# to Python's search path, e.g., `planetary_scientist_assistant/` is in sys.path).

# print("knowledge_base package is being initialized") # For debugging import paths if needed.
